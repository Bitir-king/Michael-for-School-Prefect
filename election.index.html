    <h2>Why I’m Running</h2>
    <p>
      I am <strong>Michael Kissi</strong>, and I’m running for School Prefect because I believe I
      have a great level of  leadership skills to lead us to greater heights.
      Leadership is not just about giving instructions—it’s about listening and leading the crowd,
      representing, and working together as one school community.

    <h2>My Plans for You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Student Council Committee</strong> – I plan to make a Student Council Committee where meetings are held at the end of every month to discuss the problems of students and how we can go about solving them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Memorable Events</strong> – We would hold unforgettable events like art and science exhibitions, sports tournaments and competitive leagues, fun competitions, and cultural days to bring excitement and pride into our school life.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support and Success</strong> – I will encourage peer tutoring, study groups, and extra activities that help us excel academically while building confidence and teamwork.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Recognition for Achievements</strong> – I will work on more ways to celebrate not just academic success, but also achievements in sports, arts, leadership, and service.
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Improve school atmosphere</strong> – I will improve student- teacher relationships, enhance school spirit, and promote a culture of kindness and respect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Student Well-being</strong> – I’ll push for activities that reduce stress, promote positivity, and make school a place where we all feel safe, supported, and motivated.
      </li>
    </ul>
