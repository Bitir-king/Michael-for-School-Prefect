    <h2>Early Life &amp; Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      Born in 1978 in the mineral-rich lands of Ghana’s Western Region, Michael Kissi grew up in an environment where business and ambition ran deep. His father, a successful entrepreneur in the region, laid the foundation for him to understand the value of hard work, networking, and community support. From a young age, Michael showed a sharp mind for business and an instinct for spotting opportunities — whether in trade, transport, or investments. He was not just smart but strategic. While most young men his age were focused on small ventures, Michael was already learning how to manage people, handle accounts, and make smart financial moves. This mindset would later help him build one of the most powerful business empires in the Western Region.

    <h2>Rise to Success</h2>
    <p>
      Michael Kissi’s story truly began with transportation. He founded Western Transport Services, a company that started with a few vehicles and expanded into one of the largest regional charter bus transport networks with buses, and later added trucks transporting manganese from the quarry to the port. His company became known for reliability, safety, and fair prices — qualities that earned him both respect and trust among the people of Tarkwa and beyond. He then reinvested profits into microfinance, gold refining, real estate, automotive sales, and more.
